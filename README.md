# AtliQ_Sales_Analytics

Processes I have done to build this report

1. ELT (Extract, Load, Transformt) : Instead of ETL, I performed ELT for simplicity
2. Cleaning : I did it through PowerQuery
3. Joining the tables
4. Building new measures through DAX (Data Analysis Expression)
5. Having built Pivot table
6. Converting numericals to millions through #.##,, "M" so i can get upto 2 decimal places
7. I actually built 20 vs 21 through normal percentage formula 
8. Doing Conditional formatting for my data
